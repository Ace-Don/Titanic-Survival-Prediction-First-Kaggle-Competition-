# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various features such as age, sex, and class. The notebook explores different stages of the data science pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset consists of two files:

- train.csv: The training set containing labeled data (whether a passenger survived).
- test.csv: The test set for which you need to predict survival.

##Steps Involved
- Data Exploration
- Overview of the dataset.
- Checking for missing values.
- Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.
- Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling and standardization
- Feature Engineering
- Creating new features based on existing data.
- Selecting the most relevant features.
- Model Selection and Training
- Trying out different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
- Model Evaluation
- Evaluating the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
- Prediction on Test Data
- Applying the selected model to the test dataset.
- Generating a submission file for Kaggle.
  
## Results
The model selected for the final submission achieved an accuracy of 78.468% on the test dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and model comparison can be found in the notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the notebook or want to add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
